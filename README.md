# Tic-Tac-Toe Game in Java

A simple two-player Tic-Tac-Toe game built using Java and Swing for the graphical user interface (GUI). This game allows two players to take turns playing Tic-Tac-Toe on a 3x3 grid, where one player uses "X" and the other uses "O". The game checks for a winner after every move and displays the winner with a colored highlight.

## Features

- **Two-player game:** Players alternate turns, and the game supports "X" and "O" symbols.
- **Automatic turn selection:** A random player is selected to go first.
- **Winning conditions:** The game checks for winning conditions on rows, columns, and diagonals.
- **Winner highlight:** When a player wins, their winning combination is highlighted with a background color.
- **Game Over:** The game ends when a player wins, and no further moves can be made.
